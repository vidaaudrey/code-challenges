// Define an integer's roundness as the number of trailing zeros in it. Sometimes it is possible to increase a number's roundness by swapping two of its digits.

// Given an integer n, find the minimum number of swaps required to maximize n's roundness.

// Example

// For n = 902200100, the output should be 1 (it's enough to swap the leftmost 0 with 1).
// For n = 11000, the output should be 0 (n already has the maximum roundness possible).
// [input] integer n

// A positive integer.
// [output] integer

// The minimum number of swaps required to maximize n's roundness.
