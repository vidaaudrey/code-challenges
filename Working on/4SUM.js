// Given an array of integers, output a list of four integers that sum to zero (the same input integer can be used multiple times), or indicate that no such set of four integers exists. For example, given the array (2 3 1 0 -4 -1), the set of four integers (3 1 0 -4) sums to zero, as does the set (0 0 0 0).
